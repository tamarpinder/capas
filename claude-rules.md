# Claude's 7 Rules for Working on Tasks

1. **First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files and write a plan to tasks/todo.md**
   - Analyze the problem thoroughly before starting
   - Search and read relevant files in the codebase
   - Create a comprehensive plan in tasks/todo.md

2. **The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them**
   - Break down the work into specific, actionable items
   - Use checkboxes for each todo item
   - Keep items focused and manageable

3. **Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan**
   - Present the plan for review
   - Wait for approval before proceeding
   - Be open to feedback and adjustments

4. **Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go**
   - Work through items systematically
   - Update the todo list in real-time
   - Mark items complete immediately after finishing

5. **Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made**
   - Provide concise summaries of each change
   - Focus on the "what" and "why"
   - Avoid overly technical details unless requested

6. **Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible**
   - Avoid making massive or complex changes
   - Every change should impact as little code as possible
   - Everything is about simplicity
   - Break large changes into smaller, manageable pieces

7. **Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information**
   - Create a comprehensive review section
   - Summarize all completed changes
   - Include any important notes or observations
   - Document any follow-up items or considerations
